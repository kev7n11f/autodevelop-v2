## Getting Started

### Package Manager

This project uses **Yarn** as the package manager. Please ensure you have Yarn installed before proceeding.

#### Installing Yarn
```bash
# Install Yarn globally via npm (one-time setup)
npm install -g yarn

# Or using other methods: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install
```

#### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kev7n11f/autodevelop-v2.git
cd autodevelop-v2

# Install all dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server (both backend and frontend)
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build

# Start production server
yarn start
```

#### Important Notes
- **Use `yarn` instead of `npm`** for all package management operations
- The project includes a `.npmrc` file that prevents npm from creating `package-lock.json`
- Always use `yarn add <package>` to add new dependencies, not `npm install <package>`

For more detailed setup instructions, see the frontend and backend README files.
