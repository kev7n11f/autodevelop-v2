# 🚀 Getting Started with AutoDevelop.ai v2

Welcome to AutoDevelop.ai! This guide will help you get everything up and running quickly.

## ✅ System Status

Good news! The core system is already working. Here's what's currently functional:

- ✅ **Backend Server** - Starts successfully 
- ✅ **Authentication** - User registration and login working
- ✅ **Database** - SQLite database initialized with all tables
- ✅ **Frontend** - React app builds and runs correctly
- ✅ **API Endpoints** - Health, auth, and pricing endpoints working

## 🔑 Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Servers
```bash
# Start backend (port 8080)
node backend/server.js

# In another terminal, start frontend (port 5173) 
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the System
```bash
# Run automated tests
node test-system.js
```

You should see most tests passing! 🎉

## 🔧 Optional: Full Feature Configuration

To enable all features, you'll need API keys. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

### Required for Chat Feature:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
```

### Required for Payments:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-stripe-key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your-webhook-secret
```

### Required for Email:
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-sendgrid-key
```

### Required for Production:
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-minimum-64-characters
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive system test:
```bash
node test-system.js
```

This will test all endpoints and show you exactly what's working and what needs configuration.

## 🔍 Common Issues

### "Chat endpoint not working"
- **Cause**: No OpenAI API key configured
- **Solution**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file
- **Note**: The chat framework is working, it just needs the API key

### "Payment features not available"
- **Cause**: No Stripe keys configured  
- **Solution**: Add Stripe keys to your `.env` file
- **Note**: The payment framework is ready, just needs configuration

### "Email notifications not sending"
- **Cause**: No SendGrid API key configured
- **Solution**: Add `SENDGRID_API_KEY` to your `.env` file
- **Note**: The email framework is working, emails are just simulated

## 📖 Next Steps

1. **Development**: Everything works out of the box for development
2. **API Integration**: Add your API keys to enable external services
3. **Production**: Follow the deployment guides in the repo
4. **Customization**: Explore the modular architecture to add features

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the server logs for detailed error messages
2. Run `node test-system.js` to see exact status
3. Review the `ISSUE_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` for previous fixes
4. Check that ports 8080 and 5173 aren't blocked

## 🎯 Summary

**Your AutoDevelop.ai system IS working!** The core functionality is solid. Any "not working" issues are typically just missing API keys for external services, which is normal and expected for a fresh setup.
