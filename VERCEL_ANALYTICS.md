# Vercel Analytics Configuration Guide

This document provides instructions for configuring and maintaining Vercel Analytics in the AutoDevelop.ai application.

## Overview

Vercel Analytics has been integrated into the AutoDevelop.ai frontend to provide insights into user behavior, page performance, and application usage patterns. The integration is privacy-focused and complies with privacy regulations.

## Current Setup

### Installation

The `@vercel/analytics` package has been installed in the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn add @vercel/analytics
```

### Integration

Vercel Analytics is integrated in the main React application entry point (`frontend/src/main.jsx`):

```jsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'

// Analytics component is rendered alongside the main App component
<StrictMode>
  <App />
  <Analytics />
</StrictMode>
```

## Features

The current integration provides:

1. **Automatic Page View Tracking**: Tracks page views automatically as users navigate through the application
2. **Performance Metrics**: Collects Core Web Vitals and performance data
3. **Privacy-Compliant**: No personal data collection, cookie-free tracking
4. **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with Vercel deployments

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic functionality. The analytics work automatically when deployed to Vercel.

For local development, analytics data is not sent to prevent development noise in your analytics.

### Advanced Configuration

If you need custom tracking or want to disable analytics in certain environments, you can configure the Analytics component:

```jsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'

// Example with custom configuration
<Analytics 
  debug={false}           // Set to true for development debugging
  beforeSend={(event) => {
    // Custom event filtering logic
    return event
  }}
/>
```

## Viewing Analytics Data

1. Navigate to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your AutoDevelop.ai project
3. Click on the "Analytics" tab
4. View real-time and historical data including:
   - Page views
   - Unique visitors
   - Core Web Vitals
   - Device and browser statistics
   - Geographic data

## Privacy Considerations

The Vercel Analytics integration:

- ✅ Does not use cookies
- ✅ Does not track personal information
- ✅ Complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- ✅ Aggregates data for insights without identifying individual users
- ✅ Is mentioned in the application's Privacy Policy

## Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Showing Data

1. **Verify Deployment**: Analytics only work on Vercel deployments, not localhost
2. **Check Project Settings**: Ensure Analytics are enabled in your Vercel project settings
3. **Wait for Data**: It may take a few minutes for data to appear after deployment

### Development Testing

To test analytics integration during development:

```jsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'

// Enable debug mode to see analytics events in console
<Analytics debug={true} />
```

### Build Issues

If you encounter build errors:

1. Ensure `@vercel/analytics` is in your `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`)
2. Verify React version compatibility (requires React 16.8+)
3. Check that the import path is correct: `@vercel/analytics/react`

## Maintenance

### Updating Analytics

To update to the latest version:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn upgrade @vercel/analytics
```

### Monitoring Performance

Regularly check your Vercel Analytics dashboard to:

- Monitor Core Web Vitals performance
- Identify popular pages and user flows
- Track the impact of deployments on performance
- Understand user engagement patterns

## Custom Events (Future Enhancement)

If you need to track custom events in the future, you can use the `track` function:

```jsx
import { track } from '@vercel/analytics'

// Example: Track custom user actions
const handleButtonClick = () => {
  track('button_click', { 
    button_name: 'get_started',
    page: 'home'
  })
}
```

- No sensitive user data should be tracked through custom events
- Regular security reviews should include analytics data handling practices
