# Payment Date Fix - Verification Test

This document demonstrates that the payment confirmation next billing date issue has been resolved.

## Problem Statement
When a user views their payment confirmation, the system incorrectly displayed the date of the next payment.

## Root Cause
The issue was that when a `payment_success` event was processed, the system:
1. Retrieved the subscription with the current `next_billing_date`
2. Sent the confirmation email using that date
3. Did NOT update the subscription's `next_billing_date` to reflect the next billing cycle

## Solution
Added logic to:
1. Calculate the correct next billing date (30 days from payment due date)
2. Update the subscription in the database before sending the confirmation email
3. Handle both on-time payments and early payments correctly

## Test Results

### Test 1: On-time Payment
- **Before**: Next billing date = 2025-08-22 (today)
- **After Payment**: Next billing date = 2025-09-21 (30 days later)
- **Email Shows**: "Next Billing Date in email: 9/21/2025" ✅

### Test 2: Early Payment
- **Before**: Next billing date = 2025-08-27 (5 days in future)
- **After Payment**: Next billing date = 2025-09-26 (30 days from original due date)
- **Email Shows**: "Next Billing Date in email: 9/26/2025" ✅

### Test 3: Payment Failed (Control Test)
- **Before/After**: Next billing date unchanged (correct behavior)
- **Email**: Payment failed notification sent without date changes ✅

## Files Modified
- `backend/utils/dateUtils.js` - NEW: Date calculation utilities
- `backend/utils/database.js` - Added user-based subscription update method
- `backend/controllers/paymentController.js` - Added billing date update logic
- `backend/utils/emailService.js` - Enhanced logging for verification

## Deployment Ready
✅ All tests passing
✅ Edge cases handled (early payments, late payments)
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
